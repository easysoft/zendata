  # File composition

    # zendata defines the format for each field in YAML file.
    # YAML file is composed of file description and field definition.

  # File description

    # title:   A short text to summarize the data type defined by this file.
    # desc:    Detailed text to describe the data type defined in this file, optional.
    # author:  Optional.
    # version: Version number, optional.

  # Field list

    # Field is defined in fields.
    # A YAML file contains one or more fields.
    # Field list starts from -field.
    # A child field can be defined by fields.

  # Field definition

    # field:    Field name; letters, digits, underlines and dots only.
    # range:    List range; the most important definition.
    # loop:     The number of loops; define how many times a field can loop.
    # loopfix:  The connector for each loop.

    # format:   Support formatted output.

    # prefix:   Prefix of this field.
    # postfix:  Postfix of this field.

    # length:   The length of this field. If separators are not used, specify the field length in bytes.
    # leftpad:  Left-padded characters. If the length is not enough, specify a character. The default is space.
    # rightpad: Right-padded characters. If the length is not enough, specify a character.

    # config:   Refer to the definition in other file.

    # from:     Refer to a definition file.
    # use:      Use instances defined in the referred file.
    # select:   If refer to an excel table, you can query a field in it.
    # where:    If refer to an excel table, you can use query conditions.

  # Loop Definition

    # Define the loop times of a field with a number, e.g. loop:2.
    # Define the loop times of a field with an interval, e.g. loop:2-10.

  # range definition

    # Use commas to connect elements. e.g. range: 1,2,3.
    # Elements can be a range, e.g. range:1-10, A-Z.
    # Use colons to define steps, e.g. range:1-10:2.
    # Steps can be decimals, e.g. range: 1-10:0.1.
    # Steps can be negative, e.g. range: 9-1:-1
    # Intervals can be set as random by R, e.g. range: 1-10:R. Set either random or a specified step.
    # Use a file to specify a list, e.g. range: list.txt. If the file name is a relative path, it is based on the config file.
    # Use {n} to repeat a element, e.g. range: user1{100},user2{100}.
    # Use [], if intervals and elements are repeated, e.g. range: [user1,user2,user3]{100}, [1-100]{10}.
